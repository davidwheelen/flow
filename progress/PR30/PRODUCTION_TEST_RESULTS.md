## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Production running on port 2727:2727
- ✅ One-command installation: `docker compose up -d`
- ✅ Icon directory protected and accessible
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ Nginx serving optimized build
- ✅ Multi-stage Docker build working
- ✅ Complete documentation provided

## Quick Start Verification

1. **Build and Start**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   Result: ✅ Container started successfully

2. **Check Status**:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   Result: ✅ Container running and healthy

3. **Access Application**:
   - URL: http://localhost:2727
   - Result: ✅ Application accessible

4. **Health Check**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:2727/health
   ```
   Result: ✅ Returns "healthy"

5. **Verify Icons**:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost:2727/iconpacks/isoflow-default/cloud.svg
   ```
   Result: ✅ Icon accessible (200 OK)

## Notes

- Build uses existing node_modules for speed (included in Docker context)
- For fresh builds without node_modules, may need to adjust Dockerfile
- Production image is optimized with nginx:alpine
- All security headers properly configured
- Icon packs directory is protected and never modified
