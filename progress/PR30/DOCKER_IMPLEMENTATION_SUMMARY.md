# Docker Setup Implementation Summary

## Overview

Complete Docker Compose setup has been successfully implemented for the Flow application, providing easy one-command installation and deployment for both production and development environments.

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
1. **Dockerfile** - Multi-stage production build
2. **nginx.conf** - Nginx configuration for production
3. **docker-compose.yml** - Production deployment configuration
4. **Dockerfile.dev** - Development environment
5. **docker-compose.flow-dev.yml** - Development deployment configuration
6. **.dockerignore** - Files to exclude from Docker context
7. **docs/docker.md** - Complete Docker setup guide

### Modified Files:
1. **vite.config.ts** - Added Docker compatibility (host, port, polling)
2. **README.md** - Added Docker as primary installation method

## Production Setup (Port 2727)

### Architecture:
- **Stage 1 (Builder)**: Node.js 18 for building the application
- **Stage 2 (Production)**: Nginx Alpine for serving static files

### Features:
- ✅ Multi-stage Docker build for optimized image size
- ✅ Nginx serving on port 2727
- ✅ Gzip compression enabled
- ✅ Security headers configured
- ✅ 1-year caching for static assets
- ✅ SPA routing support
- ✅ Health check endpoint at /health
- ✅ Auto-restart unless stopped
- ✅ Icon packs protected and accessible

### Quick Start:
```bash
docker compose up -d
# Access at http://localhost:2727
```

## Development Setup (Port 8181)

### Features:
- ✅ Vite development server with hot reload
- ✅ Volume mounts for instant code updates
- ✅ Polling enabled for Docker file watching
- ✅ Node modules isolated in container
- ✅ Port 8181 configured
- ✅ Development environment variables

### Quick Start:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.flow-dev.yml up
# Access at http://localhost:8181
```

## Critical Requirements Met

1. **✅ NEVER DELETE /iconpacks/isoflow-default/** - Protected via volume mounts and Dockerfile
2. **✅ Application name is Flow** - Correct branding maintained
3. **✅ Port Configuration**:
   - Production: 2727:2727 ✅
   - Development: 8181:8181 ✅

## Testing Results

### Production (Port 2727):
- ✅ Build: Successful (~15 seconds with cached dependencies)
- ✅ Container: Running and healthy
- ✅ Health check: Passing (200 OK at /health)
- ✅ Main app: Accessible (200 OK at /)
- ✅ Icons: Accessible (200 OK at /iconpacks/...)
- ✅ Security headers: Applied correctly
- ✅ Nginx: Configured properly

### Development (Port 8181):
- ✅ Build: Successful (~5 seconds with cached dependencies)
- ✅ Container: Running
- ✅ Vite server: Ready in 199ms
- ✅ Hot reload: Working via volume mounts
- ✅ Main app: Accessible (200 OK at /)
- ✅ File watching: Enabled with polling

## Documentation

### Complete Docker Guide (docs/docker.md) includes:
- Quick start instructions
- Production deployment guide
- Development environment setup
- Configuration options
- Troubleshooting section
- Advanced usage examples
- Security considerations
- Backup and restore procedures

### README.md updated with:
- Docker as primary installation method
- Quick start commands
- Links to Docker documentation
- Both production and development modes

## Build Process

### Production Build:
```
1. Copy package.json and install dependencies
2. Copy source code
3. Run npm build (TypeScript + Vite)
4. Copy built assets to nginx:alpine
5. Configure nginx for port 2727
6. Expose port and set health check
```

### Development Build:
```
1. Copy package.json and install dependencies
2. Copy source code
3. Expose port 8181
4. Run Vite dev server with hot reload
```

## Docker Images

- **Production**: `flow:latest` (~nginx:alpine size + app assets)
- **Development**: `flow:dev` (~node:18-alpine size + dependencies)

## Special Considerations

### node_modules Handling:
- Development uses node_modules from the host (included in context)
- This approach was chosen because npm install has issues in Alpine containers
- For CI/CD or fresh environments, the Dockerfile can be adjusted

### Volume Mounts:
- Production: Icon packs only (read-only)
- Development: Source code, public assets, and icon packs (all read-only)
- Node modules: Anonymous volume in development for performance

### Port Consistency:
- Both internal and external ports match (2727:2727, 8181:8181)
- No port mapping confusion
- Easy to remember and configure

## One-Command Installation

As required, Flow can now be installed and run with:
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd flow
docker compose up -d
```

Then access at `http://localhost:2727` - that's it!

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Test health
curl http://localhost:2727/health

# Test icons
curl -I http://localhost:2727/iconpacks/isoflow-default/cloud.svg

# Stop
docker compose down
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future PRs:
- Multi-architecture builds (ARM64 support)
- Docker Compose profiles for different scenarios
- Production secrets management via Docker secrets
- Volume for persistent data if needed
- Docker Compose override files for customization
- CI/CD integration examples

## Conclusion

The Docker setup is complete, tested, and fully functional. All requirements have been met:
- ✅ Production on 2727:2727
- ✅ Development on 8181:8181
- ✅ Icon directory protected
- ✅ One-command install
- ✅ Complete documentation
- ✅ All tests passing

The setup provides a professional, production-ready Docker environment for Flow.
