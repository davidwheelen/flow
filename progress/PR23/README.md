# PR23 Screenshots - Settings Panel Fix and Isometric Grid Background

This directory contains screenshots demonstrating the Flow application with the fixed Settings panel and proper isometric diamond grid background.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Settings Panel Updates
- **Removed**: Both "Peplink InControl2" and "Custom ICVA Server" buttons

## Technical Details

### Grid Implementation
File: `src/lib/flow-renderer/FlowCanvas.tsx`

The isometric grid is rendered on a separate background canvas layer:
- Background canvas: Renders the static grid pattern
- Main canvas: Renders interactive Paper.js content (devices, connections)
- Both canvases layered using absolute positioning
- Grid re-renders on window resize

Grid rendering function:
```typescript
const renderIsometricGrid = (canvas: HTMLCanvasElement) => {
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  const gridSpacing = 50; // 50px between parallel lines
  const angle = 30; // 30° isometric angle
  
  // Two sets of diagonal lines at 30° angles
  // Set 1: Down-right (↘)
  // Set 2: Down-left (↙)
  // Orange (#ff6b35) with 10px shadow blur for glow
}
```

### Settings Panel Changes
File: `src/components/Settings/Settings.tsx`

Removed elements (lines 133-166):
- "Peplink InControl2" button
- "Custom ICVA Server" button
- Button container div

Updated elements:
- Label: Changed from "API URL" to "InControl/ICVA URL"
- Placeholder: Changed to "https://incontrol2.peplink.com"
- Helper text: "IC-VA" replaced with "ICVA"

### Global Text Replacements
Files updated:
- `src/components/Settings/Settings.tsx` - UI text
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PR21.md` - Documentation
- `progress/PR21/README.md` - Documentation

All instances of "IC-VA" replaced with "ICVA"

## Verification Checklist

- Two sets of diagonal lines with proper spacing
- Orange glow effect using multiple line passes with decreasing alpha
- Settings panel matches exact requirements (no buttons, ICVA text)
